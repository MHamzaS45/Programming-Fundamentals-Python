# Week 4 — Fundamentals: Loops

Overview
Week 4 contains tasks that introduce for and while loops. 

Included files
- Week 4/#A4 TASK 4 class version.py
- Week 4/#A4 TASK 4.py
- Week 4/#A4 TASK 5. Class Version.py
- Week 4/#A4 TASK 6
- Week 4/#A4 TASK 7
- Week 4/A4 TASK 3 CLASS VER.py
- Week 4/A4 Task 1.py
- Week 4/A4 Task 2.py
- Week 4/A4 Task 3.py
- Week 4/A4 Task 5.py

What these exercises focus on
- Defining classes, constructors (__init__), instance attributes, and methods
- Creating and using instances (objects)
- Converting procedural solutions into class-based designs (class version files)
- Encapsulation of data and behavior, method design, and simple state management

How to run
- Run class-based scripts with Python: python "Week 4/A4 Task 1.py"
- If a file defines classes intended for reuse, import them from another script to exercise composition.

Notes and learning goals
- Understand when to use classes vs. functions (data + behavior → class).
- Keep classes focused: each class should represent a single concept/responsibility.
- Practice using __str__ / __repr__ for readable representations if helpful.
